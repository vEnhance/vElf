# unified-latex-prettier

## What is this?

A [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) plugin for formatting and pretty-printing LaTeX source code.

## When should I use this?

If you want to construct a `Prettier` instance that has LaTeX parsing abilities.

You should probably use the `prettier-plugin-latex` package instead of directly accessing this package.

## Install

```bash
npm install @unified-latex/unified-latex-prettier
```

This package contains both esm and commonjs exports. To explicitly access the esm export,
import the `.js` file. To explicitly access the commonjs export, import the `.cjs` file.
